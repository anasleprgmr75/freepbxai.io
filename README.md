This project's intent is to create an extension programmable on business IP Phones, linked to an OpenAI assitant. Useful for businesses, schools or research facilities, its intent is to quickly answer a question without the need to search the Web. Integrated into a phone, it functions similarly to a consumer available voice assistant (Google, Siri, Alexa, ...). However, it does not listen permanently and answer on a simple phone call.

In this tutorial, you can follow step by step the creation of a virtual extension on FreePBX, a python executable code and some custom sounds utilization.
